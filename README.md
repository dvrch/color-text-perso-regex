# Personalised Text Coloring for Obsidian

A powerful and highly customizable text coloring plugin for Obsidian, allowing you to define custom regex-based text coloring patterns with personalized colors, styles, and advanced control over text appearance.

## Features

*   **User-Defined Regex Patterns:** Create powerful coloring rules using JavaScript-flavored regular expressions.
*   **Custom Colors:** Assign a unique color to each coloring pattern.
*   **Default Text Color:** Set a global default color for all text, acting as a base before specific patterns are applied.
*   **Flexible CSS Class Assignment:** Choose from a curated list of known CSS classes or enter your own custom class for advanced styling of matched text.
*   **Capture Groups:** Color specific parts of your regex match using capture groups (e.g., `1` for the first group).
*   **Regex Flags with Tooltips:** Fine-tune regex behavior with intuitive `g` (global), `m` (multiline), and `i` (case-insensitive) flags, each providing helpful tooltips on hover.
*   **Enable/Disable Patterns:** Easily toggle individual coloring rules on or off.
*   **Enhanced Default Patterns:** Comes with an expanded set of pre-configured patterns inspired by various themes, ready to use out-of-the-box.
*   **Streamlined Settings UI:** Manage all your patterns through an intuitive settings panel with a refined layout.
    *   "Add Pattern" button conveniently located at the top for quick access.
    *   Patterns are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first) for easy management.
    *   "Reset to Defaults" button at the bottom allows you to quickly revert all settings to their initial state.
*   **Dedicated Preview Pane:** See a live preview of your coloring rules applied to the current note's content.
